# Why Did I Decide to Build GoodSport? 
    I was in Bowling Green, Kentucky on a whim. I didn't really know what it meant at the time, but I agreed to go to a dog handler agility trial. While I was there I was quite suprised by the dedication and commradarie amongst the handlers. Everyone was so enthusiastic towards their craft, a craft I'd never given a second thought. I wondered how all of these people came to find one another?  I thought "Oh, there's my idea!". 

    I had been working building some small projects with C#/.NET, and I was itching to jump into something a bit more complex, something that would challenge me to become a better developer. So, I decided to start designing this application. 

# What Did I Learn From Developing GoodSport?

    I learned a great deal about the quirks of C#. I learned to really enjoy C# as a language. I learned how much I miss static typing when I would jump over to JavaScript.  I learned a great deal about some quirks of React hooks. I found myself battling some bugs which forced me to dissect what was going on behind the hood. For example, the asynchronous nature of the useState hook. I learned a great deal in regards to creating a persistant login. I ran into different types of bugs. I'm not going to go into detail with all of them, but overcoming these issues most definitely led me to become a better developer than when I started. 

# What's Next With GoodSport?

    I plan to continue to add new features regularly. I plan to add a messaging feature. I plan to add a pagination feature. I plan to add a photo collection feature. I will continue to reconsider and refine details as time goes on.
